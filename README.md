This is an automatic key distribution mechanism for WireGuard. 

The system is simple and user-friendly, even for those with limited computer expertise.

Connecting to a wideguard across multiple devices simultaneously is a cumbersome and not instantaneous process. It requires an intermediary to solve the problem for you and sometimes it can take a while.

This mechanism is exemplified by the implementation of a simple server and a simple client. The core essential of this mechanism is that the client and the server negotiate for each session a new interface, eliminating the need for a persistent interface reserved for each person. 

In this way, the client only needs to be authenticated, and as long as the plan allows, can be online on different devices at the same time without having to request a key from the support team.

There are three plans.

Bronze - 3 devices

Gold - 5 devices

Diamond - Unlimited devices
