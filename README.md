# instant-vpn

A new key distribution mechanism for wireguard.

This mechanism is exemplified by the implementation of a simple server and a simple client.

The core essential of this mechanism is that the client and the server negociate for each session a new interface. There's no persistent interface reserved for each person.

This application for wireguard is for people. The main application is that I can connect from a different device, and as long as I'm authenticated and my plan allows it, I can be online on more than one device without having to request a key to the support team.

There are three plans.

Bronze - 3 devices

Gold - 5 devices

Diamond - Unlimited devices
